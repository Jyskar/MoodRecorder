# MoodRecorder
Every day you can input how you're feeling and a comment for the day. Can see some stats from your past inputs.

# Little Guide
You can record your mood and a comment every day by using the exe found in **/dist/GUI.exe** which has a little graphical interface and two buttons to see some stats, such as **STATS** which will show the best and worst day recorded and the average mood, and **RELEVANT** will show the date, mood and comment of days that have a mood superior to 85 or inferior to 30 and have a comment longer than 50 characters. 

# Future Plans
I plan on adding new ways to show the data such as a calendar in wich each day has a diferent color depending on the mood. But for now the simple stats and relevant days will do.

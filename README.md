# MoodRecorder
Every day you can input how you're feeling and a comment for the day.

# Little Guide
You can record your mood and a comment every day by using the exe found in /dist/GUI.exe which has a little graphical interface and two buttons to see some stats, such as STATS which will show the best and worst day recorded and the average mood, and RELEVANT will show the date, mood and comment of days that have a mood superior to 85 or inferior to 30 and have a comment longer than 50 characters. 
I plan on adding new ways to show the data such as calendar with color distinctions depending on the mood. But for now the simple stats and relevant days will do.
